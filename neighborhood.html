  <main>
    <p>The city is divided into several districts, each with its own charm. 
    District 1 is the commercial center with luxury hotels and landmarks, 
    while District 3 is known for its French colonial houses and local cafés.</p>

    <p>District 5, also called Chợ Lớn, is home to the city’s vibrant Chinatown, 
    offering an entirely different cultural experience.</p>
